0,4,1,1,0,0.666666667,4,4,3,1,3,TRUE,Correct,Tired,Yes. More rumble means I should not move there. Rumbling makes me move slower.,"A bit dizzy, tired"
1,3,2,2,4,2.666666667,4,4,4,3,3.75,FALSE,Correct,No own body,"I honestly did not notice that there was a difference in the rumbling. I felt like the rumbling was signifying either that you were hitting the extent of the robots movement capabilities. The rumbling prevented me from pushing my movement any further (even though my own body could in theory go further, the robot can't.)",I would say I experienced a degree of disembodiment. Definitely became focused on the robot's movement or my movement in the frame - rather than my own physical movement. Taking the head set off was kind of a weird and shocking return to conciousness.
2,4,1,2,4,2.333333333,3,2,3,0,2,TRUE,Correct,Tired,It made me hestiant to move in that location. I think I  thought I wasn't suppose to move in that direction.,Arm is sour trying to hold a position. 
3,3,2,0,2,1.333333333,3,4,4,0,2.75,TRUE,Correct,No own body,"I think there was additional rumbling in the 2nd half indicating the limitations, though that may have been just because I had not been asked to stretch my arms as far in the first half. There was a buzz in the right arm I think, but I didn't pay to close attention to what it meant. I more so relied on the visual of the first to then inform what would happen to my right hand. Sometimes the rumbling startled me so I corrected myself to be within a more moderate range of motion. And sometimes, the rumbling made me feel as though I had made some sort of error, so I would lower my arms and start from the neutral position. I think I would have understood more about the rumblings if I hadn't been paying as much attention to the index fingers as I had been. Overall the rumbling was helpful for knowing the limits of the robot.  ","I felt a little disembodied when taking off the headset, since it felt like I should have been facing towards myself as the robot had been, but only for a split second. I think the disembodiment/dizziness would have felt much more severe had I never used a VR headset before. I don't think the task of controlling a robot like that made the experience particularly disembodied/dizzying compared to other VR software wherein I've controlled virtual subjects."
4,3,0,0,4,1.333333333,4,4,4,1,3.25,TRUE,Hot/Cold,"Surreal, connected","Yes. In the last five puzzles, the rumbling in my controllers was low and constant. I didn't know what the rumbling was describing because I was so focused on moving my arms to match the position of the robot's arms. I think that I noticed the rumbling initially, but then I kind of forgot about it. In retrospect I wonder if the rumbling changed in intensity depending on how close I was to figuring out the puzzle. ","Surreal and super focused/present in the moment. I felt like my body and the robot's body were closely coupled but not identical. During the experiment, I was thinking about playing music in an ensemble and how we have to synchronize with each other. I was also wondering if I was completing the puzzles so quickly because maybe I have more bodily awareness than other people because of my musical experience. These wonderings were in my mind, and yet I also felt very present in the moment."
5,3,1,3,3,2.333333333,0,4,3,2,2.25,TRUE,Hot/Cold,"Comfy, connected","I did feel a difference. To me, the rumblings represented correct feedback. If my hands/arms weren’t in the spot they were supposed to be, there was no rumble. When they were in the correct part, they rumbled. This feedback was very helpful for easy puzzles. However, on the difficult ones like puzzle 8, I felt like I was relying more on the feedback than my actual sight/senses of the robot. That probably wasnt good lol.","I felt comfortable. A little tired from standing at the end, but very manageable. Towards the end, I felt very connected to the robot. Like my arms would slowly move like the robot would without even thinking about it. And also, the puzzles after 8 went by fast. It’s almost like I acclimated to the robot’s limitations and felt them in my body. "
6,3,0,1,0,0.333333333,2,4,2,0,2,FALSE,Hot/Cold,No own body,"I didn't pay attention to the difference in the rumblings, but I suppose the rumbling is indicating your pose is very  close to the target position",a bit of dissociation from the real world
7,2,1,1,0,0.666666667,0,3,3,0,1.5,FALSE,Hot/Cold,No own body,"It was a little difficult to tell exactly what the rumbling indicated or to separate between the first half and second half because the length of time it took for me to complete each was very different. My best guess is that the rumbling was meant to indicate when the height or position of the robot arm was getting close to the required bounds of the puzzle to complete it, for example in the last few tasks where I felt rumbling when I was close but not all the way to reaching the required height of my arms. I tried to use the rumbling as a marker to remember my arm position mostly because I couldn't tell exactly what it meant, but it was helpful in centering myself around the same point if I took a second to relax and move my arms back down.","The experience did feel a little strange. I especially felt a little disembodied. For the puzzles involving the left arm, it was also slightly disorienting trying to move the robot arm because it felt a lot more sluggish and less responsive than my own arm, and I had to raise my arms higher than normal to achieve an equivalent position with the robot. I also think it feels a bit weird after taking off the headset and being back in my ""normal"" body, where things still feel slightly weird and slightly disembodied."
8,1,2,0,4,2,3,4,4,1,3,TRUE,Hot/Cold,No own body,"I only recall rumbling in the first 5 puzzles whenever I got the task correct. In the second 5 puzzles, I felt like there was a rumbling leading up to the task completion rumbling. I interpreted it as telling me how close I was to completing the task.",I felt like i didn't have control of my body. not being able to see in real time was a bit debilitating. 
9,3,1,1,0,0.666666667,1,3,1,0,1.25,FALSE,Hot/Cold,OK,"I think the rumbling was supposed to be like a ""getting hotter"" or ""getting colder"", but I didn't have enough time to reason about it because I went through the poses so quickly.","Felt great. The only thing that negatively impacted completing the trials was that for some poses where an arm was supposed to be straight down I would sit there in what I thought was the pose, but really I was off by a few degrees. I think this just comes down to a difference between what the robot considers ""arms at side"" and what the human body considers ""arms at side"".

Something that was very helpful for me to quickly complete the levels was to say out loud ""ok, right hand has x fingers closed, left hand has y fingers closed, right arm is blah, left arm is bleh"" and then boom I would be done with the level relatively quickly."
10,3,2,1,1,1.333333333,3,4,4,1,3,TRUE,Hot/Cold,Tired,"I did not notice much of a pattern with the rumbling on the early puzzles, but starting from I believe the 4th puzzle, I began to notice that the rumbling would give me haptic feedback regarding how close to the correct position my arm was. This definitely made me move my arms more deliberately and experiment to find the optimal position. The rumbling was a great tool on the final 3 puzzles.",I felt stiff from standing in the same place for so long.
11,3,2,3,3,2.666666667,1,4,3,1,2.25,TRUE,Correct,Tired,"I remember feeling the rumble more when I extended my arms. The last five puzzles had more arm movement, so there was more rumbling. The rumbling may be related to how tired the robot's arm was — holding it out longer makes the arm more tired.",I felt alright. My arms were slightly tired at certain points.
12,2,1,1,3,1.666666667,0,1,3,0,1,FALSE,Correct,Tired,No. I think the controller rumbling is supposed to tell the participant that he/she is very far from the desired pose. It helped me recalibrate my pose.,Arm got tired trying to imitate the poses. Confused sometimes about what the hand poses are in the picture.
13,4,4,4,2,3.333333333,4,4,3,4,3.75,TRUE,Hot/Cold,"Tired, 2nd body","I felt like the rumbling in the last 5 puzzles was more apparent and intense, symbolizing to me that my arm position was likely close to the target position and that something else about my movement was off (e.g., finger positioning, how extended my arm was, etc.). Throughout many of the last few rounds, I felt both controllers rumble together but once I made a slight movement to either one of my arms, both controllers stopped rumbling altogether which made me think that the relative positions of each of the robot's arms to each other were vital in completing the task. The rumbling was helpful in that it gave me a benchmark as to what position/where in parallel to the robot's body that its arms should be, and it let me deduce that the thing that might be wrong with my stance is my orientation or finger positioning. ","The experience was super fun though tiring on the arms. I definitely felt like I had a 2nd body that was weighing me down and lagging. It also made me super attentive/hyper-aware of all the robot's body parts, especially its fingers."
14,3,2,1,0,1,2,4,3,1,2.5,TRUE,Hot/Cold,OK,"I believe the rumbling got more intense in the last 5 puzzles. It seemed to me like the rumbling was supposed to describe proximity to the positions of solution. It affected my own movement in the task by making me think I was close to the solution, but it may have been the rumbling was increasing due to time in each trial or some level of ""stress"" the robot would be experiencing.",Felt ok. Dealing with the weak right arm was a bit of a pain in trying to nail down the right position of it in relation to my own movements.
15,4,3,2,3,2.666666667,3,4,4,1,3,TRUE,Correct,OK,I noticed the rumbling at the boundaries at the end when I fully extended my arms. That discouraged me from going that far out. The rumbling was both good and bad - good when you got it right and it was brief and bad when it was used extensively,It felt really cool to control it. Weird to have control and watch it from like behind the robot. No dizziness or anything fatiguing. Very fun!
